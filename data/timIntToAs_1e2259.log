[2025-10-16 16:04:09]  WARNING 
 If NICER event files were generaed with HEASOFT version 6.32+,
 it is advisable to correct for the number of selected FPMs with the flag -ce for accurate
 measurement of count rates
 (buildtimeintervalsToAs.py:270)

 No correction of exposure according to number of detectors_selected per ToA interval
 This should not be an issue assuming HEASOFT 6.31- was used to reduce NICER data
