CRIMP - Code for Rotational-analysis of Isolated Magnetars and Pulsars
======================================================================

Description
-----------

These are a collection of scripts and modules to perform timing analysis on isolated neutron stars observed with high energy telescopes such as NICER, Swift, NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, Fermi, IXPE. Its main objective is to derive pulse time-of-arrival (ToAs).
